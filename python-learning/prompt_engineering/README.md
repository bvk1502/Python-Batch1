```

### 3. Task Description
**Purpose**: Clearly state what you want

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ Good: "Create a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers"
‚ùå Bad: "Do something with numbers"
```

### 4. Constraints
**Purpose**: Set boundaries and requirements

**Examples:**
```

```

## Step-by-Step Learning Path <a name="learning-path"></a>

### Level 1: Foundation (Beginner)

#### Step 1: Basic Instructions
**Goal**: Learn to give clear, simple instructions

**Example:**
```
Write a Python function that adds two numbers.
```

**Exercise**: Try these variations:
- Add error handling
- Include input validation
- Add documentation

#### Step 2: Role-Based Prompts
**Goal**: Understand how role definition affects output

**Example:**
```
You are a math teacher explaining to a 10-year-old student.
Explain how to add two numbers.
```

**Exercise**: Try different roles:
- Expert programmer
- Beginner teacher
- Technical writer

#### Step 3: Context Addition
**Goal**: Learn to provide relevant background

**Example:**
```
You are a Python tutor. The student is learning about functions for the first time.
Create a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle.
Include comments explaining each part.
```

### Level 2: Intermediate

#### Step 4: Output Formatting
**Goal**: Control how the AI structures its response

**Example:**
```
You are a coding instructor. Create a Python function to find the maximum number in a list.

Format your response as follows:
1. Function definition with comments
2. Example usage
3. Explanation of how it works
4. Common mistakes to avoid
```

#### Step 5: Constraints and Requirements
**Goal**: Set boundaries for AI responses

**Example:**
```
You are a Python expert. Write a function to sort a list.

Requirements:
- Use only built-in Python functions
- Handle empty lists gracefully
- Include type hints
- Maximum 10 lines of code
- No external libraries
```

#### Step 6: Examples and Few-Shot Learning
**Goal**: Use examples to guide AI behavior

**Example:**
```
You are a Python code reviewer. Review this code and suggest improvements.

Example of good feedback:
Code: def add(a, b): return a + b
Feedback: 
- Add type hints: def add(a: int, b: int) -> int
- Add docstring explaining purpose
- Consider edge cases (None values)

Now review this code:
[your code here]
```

### Level 3: Advanced

#### Step 7: Chain-of-Thought Prompts
**Goal**: Make AI show its reasoning process

**Example:**
```
You are a math tutor. Solve this problem step by step, showing your reasoning:

Problem: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its average speed?

Please:
1. Identify what you need to find
2. Recall the relevant formula
3. Substitute the values
4. Calculate step by step
5. Provide the answer with units
```

#### Step 8: Conditional Logic
**Goal**: Create prompts that adapt based on conditions

**Example:**
```
You are a coding assistant. Help with this Python problem.

If the user is a beginner:
- Explain each concept in simple terms
- Provide more examples
- Include common mistakes

If the user is advanced:
- Focus on optimization
- Discuss best practices
- Suggest alternative approaches

The user's level: [beginner/advanced]
Problem: [describe the problem]
```

#### Step 9: Iterative Refinement
**Goal**: Improve prompts through iteration

**Example:**
```
First attempt: "Write a Python function"
Refinement: "Write a Python function that handles edge cases"
Better: "Write a Python function that handles edge cases and includes error handling"
Best: "Write a Python function that handles edge cases, includes error handling, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines"
```

## Advanced Techniques <a name="advanced-techniques"></a>

### 1. System Messages vs User Messages

**System Message** (sets behavior):
```

```

**User Message** (specific request):
```
Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
```

### 2. Temperature and Creativity Control

**Low Temperature** (focused, consistent):
```
Temperature: 0.1
"Write a technical documentation for this API endpoint"
```

**High Temperature** (creative, varied):
```
Temperature: 0.9
"Write a creative story about a programmer debugging code"
```

### 3. Prompt Chaining

**Step 1**: Generate outline
```
Create an outline for a tutorial on Python decorators
```

**Step 2**: Expand sections
```
Using this outline, expand section 2 with detailed examples
```

**Step 3**: Review and refine
```
Review this content and suggest improvements for clarity
```

### 4. Meta-Prompts
